When I find myself in times of trouble
Em                C
Mother Mary comes to me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

And in my hour of darkness
             Em                     C
She is standing right in front of me

Living in the world agree,
    G                     D                     C G/B Am G
There will be an answer, let it be.
         G                             D
For though they may be parted there is
Em                         C
Still a chance that they will see

And when the night is cloudy,
              Em                       C
There is still a light that shines on me,
    G                      D                     C G/B Am G
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.

I wake up to the sound of music
