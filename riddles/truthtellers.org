So Dr. Smullyan is quite the playful sort and wrote quite the few of these
paradoxen, encodifying them into a calculus of paradox. This is NOT from
his Scherazade book, but from the Mensa quiz-a-day book, and you'd think,
it coming from a Mensa book, it'd be harder, but it's not. So here's the
problem statement:

Lost on Liars' and TruthTellers' Town, you are in real trouble! You need to
ask directions from a TruthTeller, but how can you tell who is a TruthTeller?
You stop a group of three [ed: Why is it always three people in these
scenarii?] women and ask if they are TruthTellers. The first says: "Two of
us are TruthTellers." The second says: "Only one of us is a TruthTeller." And
the third one chimes in: "The last woman who spoke is a TruthTeller." Well,
who was or who were TruthTellers?

data Person = Liar | TruthTeller
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)
data Speaker = First | Second | Third
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)
data Woman = W Speaker -- their ID is who spoke in which turn
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

data Statement = Truth | Falsehood
   deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

truthTellers :: [Woman] -> Set (Woman, Person) -- or something like that
truthTellers women = undefined

Smullyan has a whole book of these kinds of puzzled called the Riddle of
Scheherazade: and Other Amazing Puzzles in which via these puzzles he
develops a new kind of logic, known as coercive logic. I'm excited in
exploring this field, as I run into this occasionally at work and do
frame logics? ontologies? dependent types? all of the above? neatly address
the issues I face? Does grappling with these kinds of problems open up new
ways to solve hard problems or even open up the possibility of tackling
problems just not addressed as they are labeled as 'too hard'?

I'll see. I'll learn. I'm intrigued. Yes, by riddles that are as old as
story-telling, itself. The knights and knaves riddle is as old as the hills.

| Woman | Statement                                  |
|     1 | 2 of us are TruthTellers.                  |
|     2 | Only one of us is a TruthTeller.           |
|     3 | The last woman who spoke is a TruthTeller. |

- Hypothesis: Woman 1 is a TruthTeller. Then 2 and 3 lied! Thus rendering the 1 statement false. Absurd! 1 is a liar.
- Hypothesis: Woman 1 is a liar.
