Hello everyone, ok so it's started.
Hello everyone, I'm Antoine Dumont, I want to present you my blog-pack, how to use it and what is it.
It's a wrapper around org2blog and org-mode and wordpress to help you publishing directly form org-mode to wordpress without any extra steps.
Ok, so for this, you will have to install wordpress, because I won't do it here.
And the rest, I will show show you how to.
I will start by installing emacs, emacs24, we need it.
So let me show you my terminal.
Is the font sufficiently big?
Ok, so here we go.
I said we needed to install emacs. Ok.
So I'm on ubuntu 12.10 in a virtual machine so here are the way to install it.
So we also need org-mode packages and git.
Ok, so while it's installing, I will show my blog, my dummy blog.
browser, ok.
So here we are, a dummy-tony-blog where we have a hello world article.
yes, I will do it with the mouse.
Destroy... and delete it.

Ok so now, I will go back to the tony-dummy-blog which is installed on the virtual machine too.

We have no more article inside it, ok?
So we will go back to the terminal and this must be finished.
Yes, this is finished.
